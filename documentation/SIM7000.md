# SIM7000 Library
Note: understanding this code is *not* required to use or modify the rest of the firmware. Don't bother with the library unless it breaks or you want to add a feature.

## SIM7000 Commands
The SIM7000 uses a Hayes/AT command set. Commands are formatted as follows:
`AT+CMD`, where `CMD` is the command itself. The SIM7000 will typically respond with `OK` for a successful command, but may send additional data for some commands.

## Supported Functionality
The library currently supports HTTP requests, TCP connections, and NTP time synchronization. The SIM7000 itself has many more commands however, including the ability to locate itself, send and receive SMS and calls, and many other functions.

## A Warning
The SIM7000 is a *very* temperamental chip. It does not always transmit data successfully, it sometimes will power off without warning. It also needs very specific timing on some commands, and is not very reliable. If you want to add features, be aware of these issues. Here are a few common issues with the SIM and how to fix them:
| Issue                 | Resolution |
| -----                 | ---------- |
| Sim does not boot     | Check that wiring is correct, and verify that a capacitor is connected.
| Sim powers off randomly | Check that capacitor is connected, move to area with better signal reception, increase current available on 5V line
| Sim is not responding to commands | Make sure that UART is connected correctly and that Sim is booting
